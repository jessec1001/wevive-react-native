The easiest way to link the library is using the CLI tool by running this command from the root of your project:\n\n```\n$ react-native link @react-native-community/masked-view\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nImport the `MaskedView` component from `@react-native-community/masked-view` and use it like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport MaskedView from '@react-native-community/masked-view';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <MaskedView\n        style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row', height: '100%' }}\n        maskElement={\n          <View\n            style={{\n              // Transparent background because mask is based off alpha channel.\n              backgroundColor: 'transparent',\n              flex: 1,\n              justifyContent: 'center',\n              alignItems: 'center'\n            }}\n          >\n            <Text\n              style={{\n                fontSize: 60,\n                color: 'black',\n                fontWeight: 'bold'\n              }}\n            >\n              Basic Mask\n            </Text>\n          </View>\n        }\n      >\n        {/* Shows behind the mask, you can put anything here, such as an image */}\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#324376' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#F5DD90' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#F76C5E' }} />\n        <View style={{ flex: 1, height: '100%', backgroundColor: '#e1e1e1' }} />\n      </MaskedView>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following image demonstrates that you can put almost anything behind the mask. The three examples shown are masked `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<Image>`.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"img/example.png\" width=\"200\"></img></p>\n\n### Props\n\n- [View props...](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/blob/master/docs/view.md#props)\n\n* [`maskElement`](#maskelement)\n\n# Reference\n\n## Props\n\n### `maskElement`\n\n| Type    | Required |\n| ------- | -------- |\n| element | Yes      |\n\n<!-- badges -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/react-native-community/react-native-masked-view/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[build]: https://circleci.com/gh/react-native-community/react-native-masked-view\n[version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@react-native-community/masked-view.svg?style=flat-square\n[package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/masked-view\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@react-native-community/masked-view.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n[lean-core-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Lean%20Core-Extracted-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square\n[lean-core-issue]: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313",

This `translations.js` file can be automatically generated by the `I18n::JS::Middleware`.\n  Just add `config.middleware.use I18n::JS::Middleware` to your `config/application.rb` file.\n2. If you can't or prefer not to generate this file,\n  you can move the middleware line to your `config/environments/development.rb` file\n  and run `rake i18n:js:export` before deploying.\n  This will export all translation files, including the custom scopes\n  you may have defined on `config/i18n-js.yml`.\n  If `I18n.available_locales` is set (e.g. in your Rails `config/application.rb` file)\n  then only the specified locales will be exported.\n  Current version of `i18n.js` will also be exported to avoid version mismatching by downloading.\n\n#### Export Configuration (For translations)\n\nExported translation files generated by `I18n::JS::Middleware` or `rake i18n:js:export` can be customized with config file `config/i18n-js.yml`\n(use `rails generate i18n:js:config` to create it).\nYou can even get more files generated to different folders and with different translations to best suit your needs.\nThe config file also affects developers using Asset Pipeline to require translations.\nExcept the option `file`, since all translations are required by adding `//= require i18n/translations`.\n\nExamples:\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n- file: 'public/javascripts/path-to-your-messages-file.js'\n  only: '*.date.formats'\n- file: 'public/javascripts/path-to-your-second-file.js'\n  only: ['*.activerecord', '*.admin.*.title']\n```\n\nIf `only` is omitted all the translations will be saved. Also, make sure you add that initial `*`; it specifies that all languages will be exported. If you want to export only one language, you can do something like this:\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n- file: 'public/javascripts/en.js'\n  only: 'en.*'\n- file: 'public/javascripts/pt-BR.js'\n  only: 'pt-BR.*'\n```\n\nOptionally, you can auto generate a translation file per available locale if you specify the `%{locale}` placeholder.\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/%{locale}.js\"\n  only: '*'\n- file: \"public/javascripts/frontend/i18n/%{locale}.js\"\n  only: ['*.frontend', '*.users.*']\n```\n\nYou can also include ERB in your config file.\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n<% Widgets.each do |widget| %>\n- file: <%= \"'#{widget.file}'\" %>\n  only: <%= \"'#{widget.only}'\" %>\n<% end %>\n```\n\nYou are able to exclude certain phrases or whole groups of phrases by\nspecifying the YAML key(s) in the `except` configuration option. The outputted\nJS translations file (exported or generated by the middleware) will omit any\nkeys listed in `except` configuration param:\n\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n  - except: ['*.active_admin', '*.ransack', '*.activerecord.errors']\n```\n\n\n#### Export Configuration (For other things)\n\n- `I18n::JS.config_file_path`\n  Expected Type: `String`\n  Default: `config/i18n-js.yml`\n  Behaviour: Try to read the config file from that location\n\n- `I18n::JS.export_i18n_js_dir_path`\n  Expected Type: `String`\n  Default: `public/javascripts`\n  Behaviour:\n  - Any `String`: considered as a relative path for a folder to `Rails.root` and export `i18n.js` to that folder for `rake i18n:js:export`\n  - Any non-`String` (`nil`, `false`, `:none`, etc): Disable `i18n.js` exporting\n\n- `I18n::JS.sort_translation_keys`\n  Expected Type: `Boolean`\n  Default: `true`\n  Behaviour:\n  - Sets whether or not to deep sort all translation keys in order to generate identical output for the same translations\n  - Set to true to ensure identical asset fingerprints for the asset pipeline\n\n- You may also set `export_i18n_js` and `sort_translation_keys` in your config file, e.g.:\n\n```yaml\nexport_i18n_js: false\n# OR\nexport_i18n_js: \"my/path\"\n\nsort_translation_keys: false\n\ntranslations:\n  - ...\n```\n\nTo find more examples on how to use the configuration file please refer to the tests.\n\n#### Fallbacks\n\nIf you specify the `fallbacks` option, you will be able to fill missing translations with those inside fallback locale(s).\nDefault value is `true`.\n\nExamples:\n```yaml\nfallbacks: true\n\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/%{locale}.js\"\n  only: '*'\n```\nThis will enable merging fallbacks into each file. (set to `false` to disable).\nIf you use `I18n` with fallbacks, the fallbacks defined there will be used.\nOtherwise `I18n.default_locale` will be used.\n\n```yaml\nfallbacks: :de\n\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/%{locale}.js\"\n  only: '*'\n```\nHere, the specified locale `:de` will be used as fallback for all locales.\n\n```yaml\nfallbacks:\n  fr: [\"de\", \"en\"]\n  de: \"en\"\n\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/%{locale}.js\"\n  only: '*'\n```\nFallbacks defined will be used, if not defined (e.g. `:pl`) `I18n.fallbacks` or `I18n.default_locale` will be used.\n\n```yaml\nfallbacks: :default_locale\n\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/%{locale}.js\"\n  only: '*'\n```\nSetting the option to `:default_locale` will enforce the fallback to use the `I18n.default_locale`, ignoring `I18n.fallbacks`.\n\nExamples:\n```yaml\nfallbacks: false\n\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/%{locale}.js\"\n  only: '*'\n```\nYou must disable this feature by setting the option to `false`.\n\nTo find more examples on how to use the configuration file please refer to the tests.\n\n\n#### Namespace\n\nSetting the `namespace` option will change the namespace of the output Javascript file to something other than `I18n`.\nThis can be useful in no-conflict scenarios. Example:\n\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/translations.js\"\n  namespace: \"MyNamespace\"\n```\n\nwill create:\n\n```\nMyNamespace.translations || (MyNamespace.translations = {});\nMyNamespace.translations[\"en\"] = { ... }\n```\n\n\n### Adding prefix & suffix to the translations file(s)\n\nSetting the `prefix: \"import I18n from 'i18n-js';\\n\"` option will add the line at the beginning of the resultant translation file.\nThis can be useful to use this gem with the [i18n-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n-js) npm package, which is quite useful to use it with webpack.\nThe user should provide the semi-colon and the newline character if needed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/translations.js\"\n  prefix: \"import I18n from 'i18n-js';\\n\"\n```\n\nwill create:\n\n```\nimport I18n from 'i18n-js';\nI18n.translations || (I18n.translations = {});\n```\n\n\n`suffix` option is added in https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/pull/561.  \nIt's similar to `prefix` so won't explain it in details.\n\n\n#### Pretty Print\n\nSet the `pretty_print` option if you would like whitespace and indentation in your output file (default: false)\n\n```yaml\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/translations.js\"\n  pretty_print: true\n```\n\n\n#### Javascript Deep Merge (:js_extend option)\n\nBy default, the output file Javascript will call the `I18n.extend` method to ensure that newly loaded locale\nfiles are deep-merged with any locale data already in memory. To disable this either globally or per-file,\nset the `js_extend` option to false\n\n```yaml\njs_extend: false  # this will disable Javascript I18n.extend globally\ntranslations:\n- file: \"public/javascripts/i18n/translations.js\"\n  js_extend: false  # this will disable Javascript I18n.extend for this file\n```\n\n\n#### Vanilla JavaScript\n\nJust add the `i18n.js` file to your page. You'll have to build the translations object\nby hand or using your favorite programming language. More info below.\n\n\n#### Via NPM with webpack and CommonJS\n\n\nAdd the following line to your package.json dependencies  \nwhere version is the version you want  \n```javascript\n\"i18n-js\": \"{version_constraint}\"\n\n// Or if you want unreleased version\n// npm install requires it to be the gzipped tarball, see [npm install](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-install.html)\n\"i18n-js\": \"https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/archive/{tag_name_or_branch_name_or_commit_sha}.tar.gz\"\n```\nRun npm install then use via\n```javascript\nvar i18n = require(\"i18n-js\");\n```\n\n\n### Setting up\n\nYou **don't** need to set up a thing. The default settings will work just okay. But if you want to split translations into several files or specify contexts, you can follow the rest of this setting up section.\n\nSet your locale is easy as\n```javascript\nI18n.defaultLocale = \"pt-BR\";\nI18n.locale = \"pt-BR\";\nI18n.currentLocale();\n// pt-BR\n```\n\n**NOTE:** You can now apply your configuration **before I18n** is loaded like this:\n```javascript\nI18n = {} // You must define this object in top namespace, which should be `window`\nI18n.defaultLocale = \"pt-BR\";\nI18n.locale = \"pt-BR\";\n\n// Load I18n from `i18n.js`, `application.js` or whatever\n\nI18n.currentLocale();\n// pt-BR\n```\n\nIn practice, you'll have something like the following in your `application.html.erb`:\n\n```erb\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  I18n.defaultLocale = \"<%= I18n.default_locale %>\";\n  I18n.locale = \"<%= I18n.locale %>\";\n</script>\n```\n\nYou can use translate your messages:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.t(\"some.scoped.translation\");\n// or translate with explicit setting of locale\nI18n.t(\"some.scoped.translation\", {locale: \"fr\"});\n```\n\nYou can also interpolate values:\n\n```javascript\n// You need the `translations` object setup first\nI18n.translations[\"en\"] = {\n  greeting: \"Hello %{name}\"\n}\n\nI18n.t(\"greeting\", {name: \"John Doe\"});\n```\nYou can set default values for missing scopes:\n```javascript\n// simple translation\nI18n.t(\"some.missing.scope\", {defaultValue: \"A default message\"});\n\n// with interpolation\nI18n.t(\"noun\", {defaultValue: \"I'm a {{noun}}\", noun: \"Mac\"});\n```\n\nYou can also provide a list of default fallbacks for missing scopes:\n\n```javascript\n// As a scope\nI18n.t(\"some.missing.scope\", {defaults: [{scope: \"some.existing.scope\"}]});\n\n// As a simple translation\nI18n.t(\"some.missing.scope\", {defaults: [{message: \"Some message\"}]});\n```\n\nDefault values must be provided as an array of hashes where the key is the\ntype of translation desired, a `scope` or a `message`. The translation returned\nwill be either the first scope recognized, or the first message defined.\n\nThe translation will fallback to the `defaultValue` translation if no scope\nin `defaults` matches and if no default of type `message` is found.\n\nTranslation fallback can be enabled by enabling the `I18n.fallbacks` option:\n\n```erb\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  I18n.fallbacks = true;\n</script>\n```\n\nBy default missing translations will first be looked for in less\nspecific versions of the requested locale and if that fails by taking\nthem from your `I18n.defaultLocale`.\n\n```javascript\n// if I18n.defaultLocale = \"en\" and translation doesn't exist\n// for I18n.locale = \"de-DE\" this key will be taken from \"de\" locale scope\n// or, if that also doesn't exist, from \"en\" locale scope\nI18n.t(\"some.missing.scope\");\n```\n\nCustom fallback rules can also be specified for a particular language. There\nare three different ways of doing it so:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.locales.no = [\"nb\", \"en\"];\nI18n.locales.no = \"nb\";\nI18n.locales.no = function(locale){ return [\"nb\"]; };\n```\n\nBy default a missing translation will be displayed as\n\n    [missing \"name of scope\" translation]\n\nWhile you are developing or if you do not want to provide a translation\nin the default language you can set\n\n```javascript\nI18n.missingBehaviour='guess';\n```\n\nthis will take the last section of your scope and guess the intended value.\nCamel case becomes lower cased text and underscores are replaced with space\n\n    questionnaire.whatIsYourFavorite_ChristmasPresent\n\nbecomes \"what is your favorite Christmas present\"\n\nIn order to still detect untranslated strings, you can\ni18n.missingTranslationPrefix to something like:\n```javascript\nI18n.missingTranslationPrefix = 'EE: ';\n```\n\nAnd result will be:\n```javascript\n\"EE: what is your favorite Christmas present\"\n```\n\nThis will help you doing automated tests against your localisation assets.\n\nSome people prefer returning `null` for missing translation:\n```javascript\nI18n.missingTranslation = function () { return undefined; };\n```\n\nPluralization is possible as well and by default provides English rules:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.t(\"inbox.counting\", {count: 10}); // You have 10 messages\n```\n\nThe sample above expects the following translation:\n\n```yaml\nen:\n  inbox:\n    counting:\n      one: You have 1 new message\n      other: You have {{count}} new messages\n      zero: You have no messages\n```\n\n**NOTE:** Rails I18n recognizes the `zero` option.\n\nIf you need special rules just define them for your language, for example Russian, just add a new pluralizer:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.pluralization[\"ru\"] = function (count) {\n  var key = count % 10 == 1 && count % 100 != 11 ? \"one\" : [2, 3, 4].indexOf(count % 10) >= 0 && [12, 13, 14].indexOf(count % 100) < 0 ? \"few\" : count % 10 == 0 || [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].indexOf(count % 10) >= 0 || [11, 12, 13, 14].indexOf(count % 100) >= 0 ? \"many\" : \"other\";\n  return [key];\n};\n```\n\nYou can find all rules on <https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/37/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html>.\n\nIf you're using the same scope over and over again, you may use the `scope` option.\n\n```javascript\nvar options = {scope: \"activerecord.attributes.user\"};\n\nI18n.t(\"name\", options);\nI18n.t(\"email\", options);\nI18n.t(\"username\", options);\n```\n\nYou can also provide an array as scope.\n\n```javascript\n// use the greetings.hello scope\nI18n.t([\"greetings\", \"hello\"]);\n```\n\n#### Number formatting\n\nSimilar to Rails helpers, you have localized number and currency formatting.\n\n```javascript\nI18n.l(\"currency\", 1990.99);\n// $1,990.99\n\nI18n.l(\"number\", 1990.99);\n// 1,990.99\n\nI18n.l(\"percentage\", 123.45);\n// 123.450%\n```\n\nTo have more control over number formatting, you can use the\n`I18n.toNumber`, `I18n.toPercentage`, `I18n.toCurrency` and `I18n.toHumanSize`\nfunctions.\n\n```javascript\nI18n.toNumber(1000);     // 1,000.000\nI18n.toCurrency(1000);   // $1,000.00\nI18n.toPercentage(100);  // 100.000%\n```\n\nThe `toNumber` and `toPercentage` functions accept the following options:\n\n- `precision`: defaults to `3`\n- `separator`: defaults to `.`\n- `delimiter`: defaults to `,`\n- `strip_insignificant_zeros`: defaults to `false`\n\nSee some number formatting examples:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.toNumber(1000, {precision: 0});                   // 1,000\nI18n.toNumber(1000, {delimiter: \".\", separator: \",\"}); // 1.000,000\nI18n.toNumber(1000, {delimiter: \".\", precision: 0});   // 1.000\n```\n\nThe `toCurrency` function accepts the following options:\n\n- `precision`: sets the level of precision\n- `separator`: sets the separator between the units\n- `delimiter`: sets the thousands delimiter\n- `format`: sets the format of the output string\n- `unit`: sets the denomination of the currency\n- `strip_insignificant_zeros`: defaults to `false`\n- `sign_first`: defaults to `true`\n\nYou can provide only the options you want to override:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.toCurrency(1000, {precision: 0}); // $1,000\n```\n\nThe `toHumanSize` function accepts the following options:\n\n- `precision`: defaults to `1`\n- `separator`: defaults to `.`\n- `delimiter`: defaults to `\"\"`\n- `strip_insignificant_zeros`: defaults to `false`\n- `format`: defaults to `%n%u`\n- `scope`: defaults to `\"\"`\n\n<!---->\n\n```javascript\nI18n.toHumanSize(1234); // 1KB\nI18n.toHumanSize(1234 * 1024); // 1MB\n```\n\n\n#### Date formatting\n\n```javascript\n// accepted formats\nI18n.l(\"date.formats.short\", \"2009-09-18\");           // yyyy-mm-dd\nI18n.l(\"time.formats.short\", \"2009-09-18 23:12:43\");  // yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss\nI18n.l(\"time.formats.short\", \"2009-11-09T18:10:34\");  // JSON format with local Timezone (part of ISO-8601)\nI18n.l(\"time.formats.short\", \"2009-11-09T18:10:34Z\"); // JSON format in UTC (part of ISO-8601)\nI18n.l(\"date.formats.short\", 1251862029000);          // Epoch time\nI18n.l(\"date.formats.short\", \"09/18/2009\");           // mm/dd/yyyy\nI18n.l(\"date.formats.short\", (new Date()));           // Date object\n```\n\nYou can also add placeholders to the date format:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.translations[\"en\"] = {\n  date: {\n    formats: {\n      ordinal_day: \"%B %{day}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nI18n.l(\"date.formats.ordinal_day\", \"2009-09-18\", { day: '18th' }); // Sep 18th\n```\n\nIf you prefer, you can use the `I18n.toTime` and `I18n.strftime` functions to format dates.\n\n```javascript\nvar date = new Date();\nI18n.toTime(\"date.formats.short\", \"2009-09-18\");\nI18n.toTime(\"date.formats.short\", date);\nI18n.strftime(date, \"%d/%m/%Y\");\n```\n\nThe accepted formats for `I18n.strftime` are:\n\n    %a     - The abbreviated weekday name (Sun)\n    %A     - The full weekday name (Sunday)\n    %b     - The abbreviated month name (Jan)\n    %B     - The full month name (January)\n    %c     - The preferred local date and time representation\n    %d     - Day of the month (01..31)\n    %-d    - Day of the month (1..31)\n    %H     - Hour of the day, 24-hour clock (00..23)\n    %-H/%k - Hour of the day, 24-hour clock (0..23)\n    %I     - Hour of the day, 12-hour clock (01..12)\n    %-I/%l - Hour of the day, 12-hour clock (1..12)\n    %m     - Month of the year (01..12)\n    %-m    - Month of the year (1..12)\n    %M     - Minute of the hour (00..59)\n    %-M    - Minute of the hour (0..59)\n    %p     - Meridian indicator (AM  or  PM)\n    %P     - Meridian indicator (am  or  pm)\n    %S     - Second of the minute (00..60)\n    %-S    - Second of the minute (0..60)\n    %w     - Day of the week (Sunday is 0, 0..6)\n    %y     - Year without a century (00..99)\n    %-y    - Year without a century (0..99)\n    %Y     - Year with century\n    %z/%Z  - Timezone offset (+0545)\n\nCheck out `spec/*.spec.js` files for more examples!\n\n#### Using pluralization and number formatting together\nSometimes you might want to display translation with formatted number, like adding thousand delimiters to displayed number  \nYou can do this:  \n```json\n{\n  \"en\": {\n    \"point\": {\n      \"one\": \"1 Point\",\n      \"other\": \"{{formatted_number}} Points\",\n      \"zero\": \"0 Points\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```js\nvar point_in_number = 1000;\nI18n.t('point', { count: point_in_number, formatted_number: I18n.toNumber(point_in_number) });\n```\nOutput should be `1,000 points`\n\n\n## Using multiple exported translation files on a page.\nThis method is useful for very large apps where a single contained translations.js file is not desirable. Examples would be a global translations file and a more specific route translation file.\n\n### Rails without asset pipeline\n1. Setup your `config/i18n-js.yml` to have multiple files and try to minimize any overlap.\n\n  ```yaml\n  sort_translation_keys: true\n  fallbacks: false\n\n  translations:\n    + file: \"app/assets/javascript/nls/welcome.js\"\n      only:\n        + '*.welcome.*'\n\n    + file: \"app/assets/javascript/nls/albums.js\"\n      only:\n        + '*.albums.*'\n\n    + file: \"app/assets/javascript/nls/global.js\"\n      only:\n        + '*'\n      # Exempt any routes specific translations from being\n      # included in the global translation file\n      except:\n        + '*.welcome.*'\n        + '*.albums.*'\n  ```\n  When `rake i18n:js:export` is executed it will create 3 translations files that can be loaded via the `javascript_include_tag`\n\n2. Add the `javascript_include_tag` to your layout and to any route specific files that will require it.\n  ```ruby\n    # views/layouts/application.html.erb\n    <%= javascript_include_tag(\n          \"i18n\"\n          \"nls/global\"\n        ) %>\n  ```\n  and in the route specific\n\n  ```ruby\n    # views/welcome/index.html.erb\n    <%= javascript_include_tag(\n          \"nls/welcome\"\n        ) %>\n  ```\n\n3. Make sure that you add these files to your `config/application.rb`\n\n  ```ruby\n    config.assets.precompile += %w(\n      i18n\n      nls/*\n    )\n  ```\n\n### Using require.js / r.js\n\nTo use this with require.js we are only going to change a few things from above.\n\n1. In your `config/i18n-js.yml` we need to add a better location for the i18n to be exported to. You want to use this location so that it can be properly precompiled by r.js.\n\n  ```yaml\n  export_i18n_js: \"app/assets/javascript/nls\"\n  ```\n\n2. In your `config/require.yml` we need to add a map, shim all the translations, and include them into the appropriate modules\n\n  ```yaml\n  # In your maps add (if you do not have this you will need to add it)\n  map:\n    '*':\n      i18n: 'nls/i18n'\n\n  # In your shims\n  shims:\n    nls/welcome:\n      deps:\n        + i18n\n\n    nls/global:\n      deps:\n        + i18n\n\n  # Finally in your modules\n  modules:\n    + name: 'application'\n      include:\n        + i18n\n        + 'nls/global'\n\n    + name: 'welcome'\n      exclude:\n        + application\n      include:\n        + 'nls/welcome'\n  ```\n3. When `rake assets:precompile` is executed it will optimize the translations into the correct modules so they are loaded with their assigned module, and loading them with requirejs is as simple as requiring any other shim.\n\n  ```javascript\n  define(['welcome/other_asset','nls/welcome'], function (otherAsset){\n      // ...\n  });\n  ```\n4. (optional) As an additional configuration we can make a task to be run before the requirejs optimizer. This will allow any automated scripts that run the requirejs optimizer to export the strings before we run r.js.\n\n  ```rake\n  # lib/tasks/i18n.rake\n  Rake::Task[:'i18n:js:export'].prerequisites.clear\n  task :'i18n:js:export' => :'i18n:js:before_export'\n  task :'requirejs:precompile:external' => :'i18n:js:export'\n\n  namespace :i18n do\n    namespace :js do\n      task :before_export => :'assets:environment' do\n        I18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('config', 'locales', '*.{yml,rb}')]\n        I18n.backend.load_translations\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  ```\n\n## Using I18n.js with other languages (Python, PHP, ...)\n\nThe JavaScript library is language agnostic; so you can use it with PHP, Python, [your favorite language here].\nThe only requirement is that you need to set the `translations` attribute like following:\n\n```javascript\nI18n.translations = {};\n\nI18n.translations[\"en\"] = {\n  message: \"Some special message for you\"\n}\n\nI18n.translations[\"pt-BR\"] = {\n  message: \"Uma mensagem especial para você\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### Missing translations in precompiled file(s) after adding any new locale file\n\nDue to the design of `sprockets`:\n\n- `depend_on` only takes file paths, not directory paths\n- registered `preprocessors` are only run when the fingerprint of any asset file, including `.erb` files, is changed\n\nThis means that new locale files will not be detected, and so they will not trigger a i18n-js refresh. There are a few approaches to work around this:\n\n1. You can force i18n-js to update its translations by completely clearing the assets cache. Use one of the following:\n  \n```bash\n$ rake assets:clobber\n# Or, with older versions of Rails:\n$ rake tmp:cache:clear\n```\n\nThese commands will remove *all* fingerprinted assets, and you will have to recompile them with\n\n```bash\n$ rake assets:precompile\n```\n\nor similar commands. If you are precompiling assets on the target machine(s), cached pages may be broken by this, so they will need to be refreshed.\n\n2. You can change something in a different locale file.\n\n3. Finally, you can change `config.assets.version`.\n\n**Note:** See issue [#213](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/issues/213) for more details and discussion of this issue.\n\n### Translations in JS are not updated when Sprockets not loaded before this gem\n\nThe \"rails engine\" declaration will try to detect existence of \"sprockets\" before adding the initailizer\nIf sprockets is loaded after this gem, the preprocessor for\nmaking JS translations file cache to depend on content of locale files will not be hooked.\nSo ensure sprockets is loaded before this gem by moving the entry of sprockets in the Gemfile or adding \"require\" statements for sprockets somewhere.\n\n**Note:** See issue [#404](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/issues/404) for more details and discussion of this issue.\n\n### JS `I18n.toCurrency` & `I18n.toNumber` cannot handle large integers\n\nThe above methods use `toFixed` and it only supports 53 bit integers.  \nRef: http://2ality.com/2012/07/large-integers.html\n\nFeel free to find & discuss possible solution(s) at issue [#511](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/issues/511)\n\n### Only works with `Simple` backend\n\nIf you set `I18n.backend` to something other than the default `Simple` backend, you will likely get an exception like this:\n\n```\nUndefined method 'initialized?' for <your backend class>\n```\n\nFor now, i18n-js is only compatible with the `Simple` backend.\nIf you need a more sophisticated backend for your rails application, like `I18n::Backend::ActiveRecord`, you can setup i18n-js to get translations from a separate `Simple` backend, by adding the following in an initializer:\n\n```ruby\nI18n::JS.backend = I18n.backend\nI18n.backend = I18n::Backend::Chain.new(<your other backend(s)>, I18n.backend)\n```\n\nThis will use your backend with the default `Simple` backend as fallback, while i18n-js only sees and uses the simple backend.\nThis means however, that only translations from your static locale files will be present in JavaScript.\n\nIf you do cannot use a `Chain`-Backend for some reason, you can also set\n\n```ruby\nI18n::JS.backend = I18n::Backend::Simple.new\nI18n.backend = <something different>\n```\n\nHowever, the automatic reloading of translations in developement will not work in this case.\nThis is because Rails calls `I18n.reload!` for each request in development, but `reload!` will not be called on `I18n::JS.backend`, since it is a different object.\nOne option would be to patch `I18n.reload!` in an initializer:\n\n```ruby\nmodule I18n\n  def self.reload!\n    I18n::JS.backend.reload!\n    super\n  end\nend\n```\n\nSee issue [#428](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js/issues/428) for more details and discussion of this issue.\n\n## Maintainer\n\n- Nando Vieira - <http://nandovieira.com.br>\n\n## Contributing\n\nOnce you've made your great commits:\n\n1.

Currently being used by my project, [hackerweb-ios](https://github.com/cheeaun/hackerweb-ios).\n\n**WARNING**: The test coverage is not very high 😅\n\nInstallation\n---\n\n```\nnpm i --save react-native-cache-store\n```\n\nAPI Reference\n---\n\n- `set(key, value, [time])` - Stores the value. Expires after specified number of **minutes**.\n\n  1. `key` (string)\n  2. `value` (Object | string)\n  3. `time` (number: optional)\n\n- `get(key)` - Retrieves specified value, if not expired.\n\n  1. `key` (string)\n\n- `remove(key)` - Removes a value.\n\n  1. `key` (string)\n\n- `isExpired(key)` - Checks if a value has expired.\n\n  1. `key` (string)\n\n- `flush()` - Removes all items.\n\n- `flushExpired()` - Removes all **expired** items. This method runs every time this code is initalized.\n\nExample Usage\n---\n\n``` js\nimport CacheStore from 'react-native-cache-store';\n\nCacheStore.set('key', 'value', 10); // Expires in 10 minutes\n\nCacheStore.get('key').then((value) => {\n  // Do something with value\n});\n\nCacheStore.isExpired('key')\n  .then(() => {/* true */ })\n  .catch(() => {/* false */})\n```\n\nContribute\n---\n\nOf course, contributions welcomed! 🙌\n\nLicense\n---\n\n[MIT](http://cheeaun.mit-license.org/).",

Register as an Apple Developer\n1. Obtain a merchant ID\n1. Enable Apple Pay in your app\n\nApple has a documentation on how to do this in their _[Configuring your Environment](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/Configuration.html)_ guide.\n\n#### Android Pay\n\n1. Add Android Pay and Google Play Services to your dependencies\n1. Enable Android Pay in your Manifest\n\nGoogle has documentation on how to do this in their _[Setup Android Pay](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/setup)_ guide.\n\n### Importing the Library\nOnce Apple Pay/Android Pay is enabled in your app, jump into your app's entrypoint and make the `PaymentRequest` globally available to your app.\n\n```es6\n// index.ios.js\nglobal.PaymentRequest = require('react-native-payments').PaymentRequest;\n```\n\n### Initializing the Payment Request\nTo initialize a Payment Request, you'll need to provide `PaymentMethodData` and `PaymentDetails`.\n\n#### Payment Method Data\nThe Payment Method Data is where you defined the forms of payment that you accept.  To enable Apple Pay, we'll define a `supportedMethod` of `apple-pay`.  We're also required to pass a `data` object to configures Apple Pay.  This is where we provide our merchant id, define the supported card types and the currency we'll be operating in.\n\n```es6\nconst METHOD_DATA = [{\n  supportedMethods: ['apple-pay'],\n  data: {\n    merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.com.your-app.namespace',\n    supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'mastercard', 'amex'],\n    countryCode: 'US',\n    currencyCode: 'USD'\n  }\n}];\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Android Pay Example</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n\n```es6\nconst METHOD_DATA = [{\n  supportedMethods: ['android-pay'],\n  data: {\n    supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'mastercard', 'amex'],\n    currencyCode: 'USD',\n    environment: 'TEST', // defaults to production\n    paymentMethodTokenizationParameters: {\n      tokenizationType: 'NETWORK_TOKEN',\n      parameters: {\n        publicKey: 'your-pubic-key'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}];\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Payment Details\nPayment Details is where define transaction details like display items, a total and optionally shipping options.\n\nGoogle has excellent documentation for [Defining Payment Details](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/deep-dive-into-payment-request#defining_payment_details).\n\n```es6\nconst DETAILS = {\n  id: 'basic-example',\n  displayItems: [\n    {\n      label: 'Movie Ticket',\n      amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n    }\n  ],\n  total: {\n    label: 'Merchant Name',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nOnce you've defined your `methodData` and `details`, you're ready to initialize your Payment Request.\n\n```es6\nconst paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest(METHOD_DATA, DETAILS);\n```\n\n🚨 _Note: On Android, display items are not displayed within the Android Pay view.  Instead, the _[User Flows documentation](https://developers.google.com/android-pay/payment-flows)_ suggests showing users a confirmation view where you list the display items.  When using React Native Payments, show this view after receiving the `PaymentResponse`._\n\n### Displaying the Payment Request\nNow that you've setup your Payment Request, displaying it is as simple as calling the `show` method.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show();\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27548765-be9121c0-5a4e-11e7-8e45-4b460e314e6a.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039982-d565c68c-91d8-11e7-9cb9-2a0e58fffe6a.png\" />\n\n</details>\n\n### Aborting the Payment Request\nYou can abort the Payment Request at any point by calling the `abort` method.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.abort();\n```\n\n🚨 _Note: Not yet implemented on Android Pay_\n\n### Requesting Contact Information\nSome apps may require contact information from a user.  You can do so by providing a [`PaymentOptions`]() as a third argument when initializing a Payment Request. Using Payment Options, you can request a contact name, phone number and/or email.\n\n#### Requesting a Contact Name\nSet `requestPayerName` to `true` to request a contact name.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerName: true\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27549933-9be15be6-5a52-11e7-868a-abcfc8867968.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039983-d75d1b3e-91d8-11e7-9ac9-71d2ed12958c.png\" />\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\n🚨 _Note: On Android, requesting a contact name will present the user with a shipping address selector. If you're not shipping anything to the user, consider capturing the contact name outside of Android Pay._\n\n#### Requesting a Phone Number\nSet `requestPayerPhone` to `true` to request a phone number.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerPhone: true\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27549958-b6732160-5a52-11e7-8813-3beeeed03b9c.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039983-d75d1b3e-91d8-11e7-9ac9-71d2ed12958c.png\" />\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\n🚨 _Note: On Android, requesting a phone number will present the user with a shipping address selector. If you're not shipping anything to the user, consider capturing the phone number outside of Android Pay._\n\n#### Requesting an Email Address\nSet `requestPayerEmail` to `true` to request an email address.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerEmail: true\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27549968-c172ac34-5a52-11e7-973d-8d06a3beb5ce.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039982-d565c68c-91d8-11e7-9cb9-2a0e58fffe6a.png\" />\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\nYou can also request all three by setting them all to `true`.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerName: true,\n  requestPayerPhone: true,\n  requestPayerEmail: true\n};\n```\n\n### Requesting a Shipping Address\nRequesting a shipping address is done in three steps.\n\nFirst, you'll need to set `requestShipping` to `true` within `PaymentOptions`.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestShipping: true\n};\n```\n\nSecond, you'll need to include `shippingOptions` in your Payment Details.\n\n```diff\nconst DETAILS = {\n  id: 'basic-example',\n  displayItems: [\n    {\n      label: 'Movie Ticket',\n      amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n    }\n  ],\n+ shippingOptions: [{\n+   id: 'economy',\n+   label: 'Economy Shipping',\n+   amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.00' },\n+   detail: 'Arrives in 3-5 days' // `detail` is specific to React Native Payments\n+ }],\n  total: {\n    label: 'Merchant Name',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nLastly, you'll need to register event listeners for when a user selects a `shippingAddress` and/or a `shippingOption`.  In the callback each event, you'll need to provide new `PaymentDetails` that will update your PaymentRequest.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', e => {\n  const updatedDetails = getUpdatedDetailsForShippingAddress(paymentRequest.shippingAddress;\n\n  e.updateWith(updatedDetails);\n});\n\npaymentRequest.addEventListener('shippingoptionchange', e => {\n  const updatedDetails = getUpdatedDetailsForShippingOption(paymentRequest.shippingOption);\n\n  e.updateWith(updatedDetails);\n});\n```\n\nFor a deeper dive on handling shipping in Payment Request, checkout Google's _[Shipping in Payment Request](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/deep-dive-into-payment-request#shipping_in_payment_request_api)_.\n\n🚨 _Note: On Android, there are no `shippingaddresschange` and `shippingoptionchange` events.  To allow users to update their shipping address, you'll need to trigger a new `PaymentRequest`.  Updating shipping options typically happens after the receiving the `PaymentResponse` and before calling its `getPaymentToken` method._\n\n### Processing Payments\nNow that we know how to initialize, display, and dismiss a Payment Request, let's take a look at how to process payments.\n\nWhen a user accepts to pay, `PaymentRequest.show` will resolve to a Payment Response.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    // Your payment processing code goes here\n\n    return processPayment(paymentResponse);\n  });\n```\n\nThere are two ways to process Apple Pay/Android Pay payments -- on your server or using a payment processor.\n\n#### Processing Payments on Your Server\nIf you're equipped to process Apple Pay/Android Pay payments on your server, all you have to do is send the Payment Response data to your server.\n\n> ⚠️ **Note:** When running Apple Pay on simulator, `paymentData` equals to `null`.\n\n```es6\nimport { NativeModules } from 'react-native';\n\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { transactionIdentifier, paymentData } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n    return fetch('...', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: {\n        transactionIdentifier,\n        paymentData\n      }\n    })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(successHandler)\n    .catch(errorHandler)\n  });\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Android Pay Example</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { getPaymentToken } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n    return getPaymentToken()\n      .then(paymentToken => {\n        const { ephemeralPublicKey, encryptedMessage, tag } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n        return fetch('...', {\n          method: 'POST',\n          body: {\n            ephemeralPublicKey,\n            encryptedMessage,\n            tag\n          }\n        })\n        .then(res => res.json())\n        .then(successHandler)\n        .catch(errorHandler)\n      });\n  });\n```\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\nYou can learn more about server-side decrypting of Payment Tokens on Apple's [Payment Token Format Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PaymentTokenJSON/PaymentTokenJSON.html) documentation.\n\n#### Processing Payments with a Payment Processor\nWhen using a payment processor, you'll receive a `paymentToken` field within the `details` of the `PaymentResponse`.  Use this token to charge customers with your payment processor.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { paymentToken } = paymentResponse.details; // On Android, you need to invoke the `getPaymentToken` method to receive the `paymentToken`.\n\n    return fetch('...', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: {\n        paymentToken\n      }\n    })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(successHandler)\n    .catch(errorHandler);\n  });\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Android Pay Example</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { getPaymentToken } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n    return getPaymentToken()\n      .then(paymentToken => fetch('...', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: {\n          paymentToken\n        }\n      })\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(successHandler)\n      .catch(errorHandler);\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\nFor a list of supported payment processors and how to enable them, see the [Add-ons](#add-ons) section.\n\n### Dismissing the Payment Request\nDismissing the Payment Request is as simple as calling the `complete` method on of the `PaymentResponse`.\n\n```es6\npaymentResponse.complete('success'); // Alternatively, you can call it with `fail` or `unknown`\n```\n\n🚨 _Note: On Android, there is no need to call `paymentResponse.complete` -- the PaymentRequest dismisses itself._\n\n## Testing Payments\n\n### Apple Pay\n\nThe sandbox environment is a great way to test offline implementation of Apple Pay for apps, websites, and point of sale systems. Apple offers [detailed guide](https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-pay-sandbox/) for setting up sandbox environment.\n> ⚠️ **Note:** It is also important to test Apple Pay in your production environment. Real cards must be used in the production environment. Test cards will not work.\n>\n> ⚠️ **Note:** There are known differences when running Apple Pay on simulator and real device. Make sure you test Apple Pay on real device before going into production.\n\n## Apple Pay Button\n\nProvides a button that is used either to trigger payments through Apple Pay or to prompt the user to set up a card.\n[Detailed docs and examples](packages/react-native-payments/docs/ApplePayButton.md)\n\n## Add-ons\nHere's a list of Payment Processors that you can enable via add-ons:\n- [Stripe](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments-addon-stripe)\n- [Braintree](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments-addon-braintree)\n\n🚨 _Note: On Android, Payment Processors are enabled by default._\n\n## API\n### [NativePayments](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments/docs/NativePayments.md)\n### [PaymentRequest](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments/docs/PaymentRequest.md)\n### [PaymentRequestUpdateEvent](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments/docs/PaymentRequestUpdateEvent.md)\n### [PaymentResponse](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments/docs/PaymentResponse.md)\n\n## Resources\n### Payment Request\n- [Introducing the Payment Request API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request)\n- [Deep Dive into the Payment Request API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/deep-dive-into-payment-request)\n- [W3C API Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/)\n- [Web Payments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0LkQijSeko)\n- [The Future of Web Payments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU89pPBmhds)\n\n### Apple Pay\n- [Getting Started with Apple Pay](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/get-started)\n- [Configuring your Environment](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/Configuration.html)\n- [Processing Payments](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/ProcessPayment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014764-CH5-SW4)\n- [Payment Token Format Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PaymentTokenJSON/PaymentTokenJSON.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014929)\n\n### Android Pay\n- [Setup Android Pay](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/setup)\n- [Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/tutorial)\n- [Brand Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/brand-guidelines)\n- [Gateway Token Approach](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/android-pay#gateway_token_approach)\n- [Network Token Approach](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/android-pay#network_token_approach)",
